# BizCard  
This repository is the result of learning basic Android Jetpack Compose.

I learned this material from the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/105sI63@nBHmRb0r4btreKibNGxvqu2dc6Vvj7RcENpFMIrxsIh4StcAX1b3756RnbxPAIWM/) course.
You need to know, in the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/105sI63@nBHmRb0r4btreKibNGxvqu2dc6Vvj7RcENpFMIrxsIh4StcAX1b3756RnbxPAIWM/) video this project uses the `compose.material.*` library, while I use `compose.material3`. So there are some code adjustments in this project.

The code example is as follows :

 1. Library compose.material.*
 Set for card elevation
 `elevation = 4.dp`
 
 2. Library compose.materia3. 
 Set for card elevation
 `elevation = CardDefaults.cardElevation(defaultElevation = 4.dp)`
